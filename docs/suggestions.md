### Illusory conjunctions

Illusory conjunctions are quirks of our perceptual system. In the visual domain, when objects
are presented only briefly and attention is directed elsewhere, we are prone to combine
properties of different objects and perceive them as belonging to the same object. This project
would replicate an influential experiment to demonstrate that visual illusory conjunctions can
exist.

# Suggestions 

A bunch of ideas for studies you might try to replicate.

### Impact of metaphors on reasoning

When people hear about crime in a city described as a *beast* they tend to suggest
counter-measurements based on aggressively fighting back the symptoms; if they hear it
described as a *disease* they tend to rather suggest counter-measurements that would target the
source of the problem. Thibodeau & Boroditsky's paper has been influential and sparked
controversy, including attempts to replicate the main findings.

### Illusory conjunctions

Illusory conjunctions are quirks of our perceptual system. In the visual domain, when objects
are presented only briefly and attention is directed elsewhere, we are prone to combine
properties of different objects and perceive them as belonging to the same object. This project
would replicate an influential experiment to demonstrate that visual illusory conjunctions can
exist.

### Knowledge inference in Scalar implicature

When Jones says "Some of the phones are broken" Smith understands that Jones is in no position
to have said "All of the phones are broken". Either Jones knows that not all of them are
broken, or she doesn't know. Goodman & Stuhlmüller provide a model of reasoning about language
use taking into account a speaker who might not know all the relevant facts. Try to replicate
their study, and possibly even use their probabilistic model of language use to fit it to the data.

### Object-biases in visual attention

Humans are faster at detecting a visual stimulus when it occurs on an object they were paying
attention to. This is a classic study with plenty of opportunity to learn about proper stimulus
timing and reaction time recording.

### Probability matching

There are two buttons. Each trial the participant clicks on one of them and either receives a
reward or does not. The probability of receiving a reward is, in the simplest case, a different
constant for each button. Rational choice theory predicts that participants should only ever
press the button with higher probability of a reward. But they don't! They tend to press
buttons based on the probability with which they expect a reward.

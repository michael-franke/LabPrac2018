# Experimental Psychology Lab Practice

Experimental work is hard. Opportunities for suboptimality and failure abound. This course is
all about avoiding pitfalls and cultivating a mindset aimed at continually improving
practices. We will execute the whole process of implementation, execution and data analysis
during this course, based on a replication of an existing experiment, which we will preregister.
